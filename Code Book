Variables Descripe:
===================
-test_x: contain the data from x_test.txt
-test_y:contain the data from y_test.txt
-test_subjec: contain the data from test/subject.txt
-train_x: contain data from x_train.txt
-train_y: contain data from y_train.txt
-train_subject: contain data from train/subject_train.txt
-test_data: contain merged data from x_text.txt and y_test.txt
-train_data: contain merged data from x_train.txt and y_train.txt
-full_data: contain fully merged data from test_data and train_data
-data_feature: contain data from features.txt
-mean: grab the id of mean data
-std: grab the id of standard data
-data_mean: contain the mean data from the fully merged data set
-data_std: contain the standard data form the fully merged data set
-activ: contain data from activity_labels.txt
-T:it's a temp varialbe use to assist assign activity labels to the fully merged data set

Study Design:
================
The whole process is merge test data and train data seperatly and do a second merge to make a fully merged data set
it's make the code more readable and easy to understand rather than merge them in one step
